# Density

There is an explosion in the number of frameworks looking to hit what is considered the gold stardard in many ecological surveys - population density information. 

We have plans for some worked examples of these in the pipeline, as a placeholder we point you towards some key material: 

```{r, echo=F, results='hide', message =F, warning=F}
# Check you have them and load them
list.of.packages <- c("kableExtra", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "lme4", "dplyr", "unmarked", "lubridate")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

```
