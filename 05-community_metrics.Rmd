# Community composition {#composition}

**By Christopher Beirne and Laura Stewart**

One of the most fundamental questions researchers and practitioners want to answer with camera traps is *how many species are there in my survey area?*. However, exploring patterns in species richness can also tell us if we have performed 'enough' surveying. 

```{r, echo=F, results='hide', message =F, warning=F}
# Check you have them and load them
list.of.packages <- c("iNEXT", "kableExtra", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "dplyr")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

```

## Observed richness
The simplest way to quantify species richness is counting the number of species you detect on your camera traps - 'observed richness'. This is very easy to determine using our species list:

```{r}
sp_summary <- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_species_list.csv", header=T)
# Use nrow() to count the number of species
```

In the case of the example data set, this represents `r nrow(sp_summary)` species. 

```{r, echo=F}
sp_summary %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) 
```

It is possible to compare observed richness across different strata of interest, **however** survey effort must be identical between your comparison strata. This very rarely the case in camera trap studies where cameras break, run out of battery or are deployed for different lengths of time. 

The number of species you detect is a function of the amount of effort you spent surveying or the number of individuals detected - the longer a camera is active/the more individuals detected the more species it will detect. Observed richness typically underestimates true richness. Consequently, We need a way of comparing species richness which accounts in some way for survey effort.

## Estimated richness

There are two commonly used ways to account for survey effort when estimating species richness using camera traps:

  i)  using the incidence of rare species to 'correct' observed richness (non-parametric estimators) 
  ii) using multispecies occupancy models to account for the species present but not observed 


### 1) Incidence patterns

#### iNext package

The [iNext package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iNEXT/) (INterpolation and EXTrapolation of species richness) - is an easy to use and comes with a wealth of plotting functions - see the [iNext Quick Introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iNEXT/vignettes/Introduction.pdf) for a great walk through tutorial. Its core functionality is based on:

*Chao et. al. (2014) Rarefaction and extrapolation with Hill numbers: a framework for sampling and estimation in species diversity studies. Ecological Monographs*

To run this example code you will need `iNEXT` , `ggplot2`, and `gridExtra` packages.

```{r}
library(iNEXT); library(ggplot2); library(gridExtra)
```

**Single strata**

You may want to see if your camera project has sufficient survey effort to capture the species within the focal area. To do this we can produce species accumulation curves across the site as a whole. Species accumulation curves plot the increase in species richness as we add individuals or survey units. If the curve plateaus, flattens, then that suggests you have sampled the majority of the species in your survey area.

*Data formatting*

Applying the iNEXT functions to camera trap data is perhaps simplest using 'abundance' function, this represents the frequency with which each species is detected. Implementing the abundance data requires a string of abundance frequencies contained within a list. We can create this format from the total observations dataset we crated:

```{r}
# Import the total observations dataset
total_obs <- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_30min_independent_total_observations.csv", header=T)

# Make an empty list to store our data
project_level <- list()
# Sum all of the observations of each species (colSums), and then make it an element in the list
project_level[[1]]<- colSums(total_obs[, sp_summary$sp])
# Give it a name
names(project_level) <- "project_level"
```

This will produce a list object which looks like this: 

```{r, echo=F}
project_level
```

**Analysis**

Once you have created your list, it is simple to run a basic iNEXT analysis, and create a graphs of the result. Below we show a basic iNEXT call with some of its default arguments.

```{r}
out <- iNEXT(project_level,          # The data frame
             q=0,                    # The type of diversity estimator (see below)
             datatype="abundance",   # The type of analysis
             knots=40,               # The number of data points in your line (more = smoother)
             se=TRUE,                # Logical statement if you want confidence intervals
             conf=0.95,              # The level of confidence intervals
             nboot=50)               # The number of replications to perform - this generates your confidence interval - the bigger the number the longer the run time


```

**a note on q values**

The iNEXT package uses the concept of hill numbers to calculate its community indices. The values of q reflect traditional diversity estimators: 

  - 0 = species richness 
  - 1 = Shannon diversity
  - 2 = Simpson diversity 
  
**a note on coverage**

Whilst many uses will be familier with diversity indices, iNEXT also calculates 'sample coverage' - the proportion of the total number of individuals that belong to the species detected in the sample. The way to think about this is, if you an an unsurveyed individual to the population you have surveyed, what is the likelyhood it belongs to the species not already detected? If your sample coverage is high, this probability will be very low! 
  
  
We will start with observed richness. 

The `iNEXT()` function returns the "iNEXT" object including three output lists: 
- `$DataInfo` for summarizing data information
- `$iNextEst` for showing size- and coverage-based diversity estimates along with related
statistics for a series of rarefied and extrapolated samples
- `$AsyEst` for showing asymptotic diversity estimates along with related statistics. 

```{r, eval=F}
out
```

Lets check out each one in turn:

`$DataInfo` is  shown below, returns summary data such as the reference sample size (n), observed species richness (S.obs - which is hopefully the same as what we calculated above), sample coverage estimate for the reference sample (SC), and the first ten frequency counts (f1‐f10).

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/community_metrics/data_info.PNG")
```

`$iNextEst` output includes two data frames: `$size_based` and `$coverage_based`.

Let's first look at `$iNextEst$size_based`:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/community_metrics/size_based.PNG")
```

Next `$iNextEst$coverage_based`:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/community_metrics/coverage_based.PNG")
```

`$AsyEst` gives the asymptotic estimates and their related statistics.

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/community_metrics/AsyEst.PNG")
```

One of the powerful elements of iNEXT is that it can extrapolate beyond your data, this is very useful when you do not have equal sample sizes. 


## Basic results plot

```{r, warning=F}
p1 <- ggiNEXT(out, type=1)+ theme_classic()    #  type 1 = the diversity estimator
p2 <- ggiNEXT(out, type=2)+ theme_classic()    #  type 2 = the survey coverage
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

At this end of this section we will demonstrate how to create your own plots using the iNEXT output. 

**Multiple strata**

The iNEXT package gets really interesting when we start to compare multiple different strata. e.g. different treatment types or species groupings. 

The code to build a multi strata comparison is very similar to that of a single strata, except now you separate the observations into their relevant categories. 

We will now compare the different categories in the ***To make this split, we refer to the 'camera_locations.csv' dataframe, which contains the 'feature_types' for each camera station. We match the 'placenames' in our locations dataframe with the corresponding capture data in `total_obs`  using the `%in%` command (this is one of our favourite commands). ***

```{r}
# Read in the locations data frame

locs <-  read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_camera_locations.csv")

# We first want to create a data subset for each of the strata we are interested in:

# The treatment types for each Deployment.Location.ID are in the sta file
# Make an object containing all of the site ID's for the "Offline" cameras
off <- locs$placename[locs$feature_type=="Offline"]
# And "HumanUse" cameras
hum <- locs$placename[locs$feature_type=="HumanUse"]

# Create a new empty list
strata <- list()

# Only sum the data for each relvent strata
strata[[1]] <- colSums(total_obs[total_obs$placename %in% off, sp_summary$sp])
strata[[2]] <- colSums(total_obs[total_obs$placename %in% hum, sp_summary$sp])
# Give them names
names(strata) <- c("Offline", "HumanUse")
```

Then, as before, run your iNEXT model and examine the output:

```{r}
out <- iNEXT(strata, datatype="abundance")
p1 <- ggiNEXT(out, type=1)+ theme_classic() 
p2 <- ggiNEXT(out, type=2)+ theme_classic() 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

From the plot on the left you can see that the 'HumanUse' strata detected more species than the 'Offline' strata. The plot on the right suggests that we have likely sampled all of the species that will be detected within these habitats (samples are 'complete').


## Sampling-unit-based incidence data

The example above is useful, but we typically do not think about our survey effort in terms of the number of individuals we catch, rather we think about the number of camera stations we deploy on the landscape, or perhaps units of time (e.g. camera days). 

Performing our species accumulation curves using survey location, rather than individuals encountered, allows us to determine if we have enough survey locations in a given strata to detect all of the species present.

Performing the analyses using camera_days would also give insight into whether we need for survey effort in a given location. 

The dataformatting for a sampling-unit based accumulation curve is diffferent to that of an individual-based curve. As before we need a list of strata, however now we need the elements in the list to represent the number of sampling units first, then the number of those unites where a given species was detected follow it:

### Survey station example

Lets build this example for survey stations

```{r}
# As before we can use out total_obs dataframe.
inc_dat <- total_obs %>% mutate(across(sp_summary$sp, ~+as.logical(.x)))

# Create a new empty list
inc_locations <- list()

# Only sum the data for each relvent locations
inc_locations[[1]] <- c(length(off),  # Count the number of stations
                     # Then subset the detections to those stations, sum the columns, and sort the incidents
                     inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% off, sp_summary$sp] %>%  colSums() %>% sort(decreasing=T))


inc_locations[[2]] <- c(length(hum),  # Count the number of stations
                     # Then subset the detections to those stations, sum the columns, and sort the incidents
                     inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% hum, sp_summary$sp] %>%  colSums() %>% sort(decreasing=T))

# Give them names
names(inc_locations) <- c("Offline", "HumanUse")

```


```{r}
out.inc <- iNEXT(inc_locations, q=0, datatype="incidence_freq")
# Sample‐size‐based R/E curves
ggiNEXT(out.inc, type=1, color.var="Assemblage") +
theme_bw() 
```

### Sampling duration example

If we want to explore the species accumulation patterns as a function of the number of survey nights, we can make use of the 'obs_week' dataframes.

```{r}
week_obs<- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_30min_independent_weekly_observations.csv", header=T)


# As before we can use out total_obs dataframe.
inc_dat <- week_obs %>% mutate(across(sp_summary$sp, ~+as.logical(.x)))

# Create a new empty list
inc_time <- list()

# Only sum the data for each relvent strata
inc_time[[1]] <- c(nrow(inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% off,]),  # Count the number of weeks we have data for in each strata
                     # Then subset the detections to those stations, sum the columns, and sort the incidents
                     inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% off, sp_summary$sp] %>%  colSums() %>% sort(decreasing=T))


inc_time[[2]] <- c(nrow(inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% hum,]),  # Count the number of stations
                     # Then subset the detections to those stations, sum the columns, and sort the incidents
                     inc_dat[inc_dat$placename %in% hum, sp_summary$sp] %>%  colSums() %>% sort(decreasing=T))

# Give them names
names(inc_time) <- c("Offline", "HumanUse")

```

```{r}
out.inc <- iNEXT(inc_time, q=0, datatype="incidence_freq")
# Sample‐size‐based R/E curves
ggiNEXT(out.inc, type=1, color.var="Assemblage") +
theme_bw() 
```

## Other diversity metrics

### Simpson and Shannon

One issue with species richness assessments is that they weight all species equally, thus a community with 12 species all present in equal abundances will give you the same richness value as a high skewed community with one highly abundant species, and 11 very rare ones. Consequently, you might want to estimate species diversity.

Luckily, the iNEXT package is well suited for comparisons of diversity indices through the use of hill numbers - of which the 'q' value represents the traditional Shannon (q=1) and Simpson (q=2) diversity indices (species richness: q = 0). *Note* Increasing values of q reduces the influence of rare species on your estimate of community diversity. 

For example, we might want to compare the species diversity across our two focal strata:  

```{r}
# We also introduce the object t -> which reflects the range of values over which you want to predict species richness
out <- iNEXT(inc_time, q=c(0,1,2) ,datatype="incidence_freq" )

ggiNEXT(out, type=1, facet.var="Order.q", color.var="Assemblage") + theme_classic() 
```

The plot above shows that the differences between our two strata remain across increasing q values (suggesting that the different inst just driven by several rarely encountered species). 

Point estimates and their confidence intervals can also be extracted from iNEXT model objects - but it does require a little data wrangling. For example, if we wanted to directly compare the diversity estimates of our strata at 1000 survey units:

```{r}
# To generate predictions for specific amounts of survey effort, we make use of the variable t
# T specifies the values you want iNEXt to calculate diversity for
out <- iNEXT(inc_time, q=c(0,1,2) ,datatype="incidence_freq", size=c(1000))

# The lapply function applies the same logic across elements in a list
point_estimate <- out$iNextEst$size_based[out$iNextEst$size_based$t==1000,] 
point_estimate
# Make a nice ggplot!
ggplot(point_estimate, aes(x=c(-0.1,0.9, 1.9,
                                0.1, 1.1, 2.1), y=qD, colour=Assemblage)) + 
       theme_classic() +
       #scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("1","2"),labels= c("1","2")) +
       geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=qD.LCL, ymax=qD.UCL), width=.01) +
       labs(y="Diversity", x = "Diversity at 1000 survey units") +
       geom_point() 
```
