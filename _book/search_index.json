It was born out of the realization that many analysis frameworks we apply as camera trappers, do not have specific examples which involve camera trap data. Thus we wanted a resource which takes a single data set from raw data to analysis, showing all of the steps in between! 1.1 What this guide is An R code reference manual for basic concepts in the exploration and analysis of camera data A tool to provide hands on experience of standardized camera trap data in R A link to resources and papers which showcase the types of analyses you can perform A growing document which will be updated and curated by the Wildlife Coexistence Lab at UBC 1.2 What this guide is not A step-by-step guide to the “best” way to explore or analyse your data (although we hopefully provide a good foundation) A statistics guide. The analyses presented within this guide are purposefully overly simplified in order to act as an introduction to each topic without being overwhelming. We link to more comprehensive resources where ever possible. 1.3 How to use this guide Browse the pages from the Table of Contents, or use the search box if you are after something specific If you don’t want to use GitHub, you can download the data and ‘follow-along’ cutting and pasting the code Explore addition “Further reading” sections at the end of each section for more information or applied examples of the methods discussed 1.4 Get in touch If you have any questions about this document and the information it contains, please email us or, better still, submit an issue on our data analysis GitHub page. 1.5 Acknowledgements This guide is produced by the members of the Wildlife Coexistence Lab at UBC.
