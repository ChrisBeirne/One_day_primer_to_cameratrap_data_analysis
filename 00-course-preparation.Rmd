# Preparing for the course

In order reproduce the data management and analysis examples detailed in this book, you will need to take the following steps. 

## Download R Studio

## Create an R project

## Download the data files

We have two data sets!

- Example dataset -> ALGAR [Different treatments]

This data was analysed in:
