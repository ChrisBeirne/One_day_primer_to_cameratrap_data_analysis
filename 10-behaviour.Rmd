# Phenology

```{r, echo=F, results='hide', message =F, warning=F}
# Check you have them and load them
list.of.packages <- c("kableExtra", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "phenopix")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

```

Phenopix is an R package which allows the user to extract visual information from time lapse images.  It provides a quantitative daily measure of vegetation phenology at each site (e.g. green-up, senescence, snow cover)


The Phenopix package has a five step process:
  i) a region of interest (ROI) is identified;
  ii) the red, green, and blue digital numbers from each image in the timeseries is extracted and an index of relative ‘greenness’ is computed and plotted from the digital numbers; 
  iii) the vegetation indices’ data points are filtered to remove inconsistencies; 
  iv) a curve is fit to the data and phenophases are determined from the curve; 
  v) and phenophase uncertainties are calculated.
