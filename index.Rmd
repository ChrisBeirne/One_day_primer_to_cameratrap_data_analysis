# Introduction

```{r ch0_1, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(bookdown)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Ninja.png")
```

**This is an abridged version of the full three day course located here:** 

[An Introduction to Camera Trap Data Management and Analysis in R](https://wildcolab.github.io/Introduction-to-Camera-Trap-Data-Management-and-Analysis-in-R/). 

That version will be the most up-to-date and comprehensive.  

## How to use this book

You can run this code to get a quick flavour for camera trap data analyses and work flows. 

- [Download the example data via dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fpnsinyn1ml9x28/AAB-Y-glHHRDsiCdmQnVLx7Wa?dl=0) and 'follow-along' by cutting and pasting the code

**Important note** The code chunks are color coded by their function:

```{r, class.source="Rmain"}
# Green chunks are essential code which must be copied and run in 
# R for the document to work
```

When you hover over these colored chunks a 'copy' symbol will appear in the top right to transfer your code!

```{r ch0_3, echo=F}
print("Gray code chucks are code output from R")
```
