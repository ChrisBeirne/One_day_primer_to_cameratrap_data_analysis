# Introduction

## What this guide is 

- An R code reference manual for basic concepts in the exploration and analysis of camera data
- A tool to provide hands on experience of standardised camera trap data in R 
- A link to resources and papers which showcase the types of analyses you can perform (and would maybe want to replicate in the future)
- A 'living' document - it will updated and curated by different lab members through time


## What this guide is not

- The "best" way to explore / analyse your data (although we hopefully provide a good foundation)
- The "best" R code for camera traps
- A static document

## How to use this guide

- Browse the pages from the Table of Contents, or use the search box
- You can 'follow-along' using the example data and code
- Explore addition “Resources” at the end of each section for great applications of camera trap data
